        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At LaunchBrightly, we are on a mission to automate <a href=\"https://launchbrightly.com/product.html\">a process that continually captures and enhances screenshots of all your SaaS product features</a>. The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline and process that engineers adopted over the last decade, is what we ultimately want to build for customer support teams. TLDR; LaunchBrightly = Github Actions/Circle CI for customer support. And we are currently looking to bring onboard a strong <strong>Application Engineer</strong>.\u00a0</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone at LaunchBrightly is a creator, an owner, or perhaps better, a celebration of the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. Most big companies are afraid of entrusting the future of the company and their software to a few makers, and as they defend against that, they end up with three layers of managers and a product designed by a committee. We want the opposite. We need the opposite as we enter virgin territory trying to build that CI/CD pipeline and process for the support organization. As our customer pushes a new feature to production, we automatically update all product images within the help center. This is a thrilling adventure!</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Our work is remote, not distant. We believe that being a remote-first organization allows us to build an exceptional team composed of makers and sellers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets from around the globe. Our default work culture is asynchronous and emphasizes written communication to prioritize maker time, focus and company productivity. Our goal is not to eliminate face-to-face interaction, but we should default to a setting where written documentation is so strong that a meeting on most project subject matters would seem odd.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Founded in 2022, and backed by prominent venture firms including IA Ventures, Tuesday Capital, and B Capital Group, this is a unique opportunity to join this band of misfits on the ground floor. As an early teammate you will be working intimately with the founding team, who has done 0 to 1 five times over while seeing four of them come to an exit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Application Engineer</strong> will become an integral member of an intimate 9-person team consisting of:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #7 (Application Engineer, You!)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #6 (Melissa, Implementation Specialist)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #5 (Michel, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #4 (Lucas, Frontend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #3 (Jose, Fullstack Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #2 (Hyder, Backend Engineer)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Maker #1 (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennismortensen\">Dennis</a>, Founder)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Seller #1 (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuacpeacock/\">Josh</a>, Co-founder)</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Helper #1 (Vibeke)</p></li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">However, we are looking not just for an Engineer but, rather, a teammate we see as integral to LaunchBrightly\u2019s long-term journey and vital to our success. Someone who is comfortable in the dark and who sees a certain romance, like we do, in embracing the unknowns that come with being on the startup journey. We have a track record of seeing those colleagues who join us on the ground floor of our ventures ride the startup journey to completion (exit) with us, as we grow and become successful together. This is something we take seriously, and something we are extremely proud of!\u00a0</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Job Description</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">You'll work with Jose (and the remainder of the team) on the logic layer that powers our product: workflows, task runners, state machines, rules engines, and orchestration. You'll work in Typescript directly in the Vue App, and often in JS in AWS Lambda\u2019s, tune our data models, and shape how primary product features like Audits function behind the scenes. You're not building APIs or UI \u2014 you're building the actual product behavior. Think of yourself as a Product Logic &amp; State Orchestration Engineer.\u00a0</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is a hands-on role for an engineer who loves building reliable systems that model real-world processes. You\u2019ll work on the internal state machines that govern how screenshots flow through the system, are transformed, enhanced, and delivered. You\u2019ll define rules engines that let non-technical users control automated behavior, manage task orchestration across Lambda and queues, and shape our schema design to handle complex edge cases with clarity and performance in mind.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You\u2019ll thrive in this role if you think deeply about how complex systems behave over time, have strong opinions on data modeling and event-driven workflows, and enjoy writing deterministic, testable, observable logic. If you care more about product behavior than presentation, and love turning business intent into robust execution \u2014 this is for you!</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">We are looking for previous experience working with</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Building production-grade B2B web apps, including everything that comes with robust, scalable software: business logic, testing, observability, and performance.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Writing TypeScript in a modern frontend architecture (Vue 3 SPA) and JavaScript in AWS Lambda functions.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Working deeply to create meaningful and maintainable test coverage across core business logic (e.g. Vitest).</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Designing and modeling robust data schemas for DynamoDB and GraphQL queries, with a strong intuition for how data shapes product behavior.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Consuming and reviewing internal APIs using Postman, and contributing clear, actionable feedback to improve them.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Implementing Serverless architecture with AWS Amplify, including event-driven flows and task orchestration.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Having a good functional understanding of UI-layer concerns (HTML, DOM, TailwindCSS, HeadlessUI), but focusing your energy on what happens beneath the surface \u2014 the orchestration, rules, and workflows that make the app tick.</p></li></ul><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What you bring to the table</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Minimum of 3 years of industry experience</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A customer-first mentality, with an instinct to imagine how users will react and interact</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Strong and precise communication and documentation skills, with a will to understand and be understood</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Prides themselves on writing highly readable, thoroughly tested code</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">The personal organization skills and patience to manage multiple contexts as projects and features come together. A good dev can do things like: juggle tickets and Git branches, keep zero inbox, write notes for themselves to keep their small tasks straight, whip up shell scripts/test data to automate repetitive tasks</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A passion for being part of the startup journey and taking ownership of the company\u2019s success</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">A willingness to take initiative and enthusiasm to make an impact and take action</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Thrives in a highly collaborative environment and enthusiasm for being a team player</p></li></ul><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Bonus point if you</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Built Apps on the AWS Amplify (Serverless Design) framework, which is the primary backdrop for our App.\u00a0\u00a0</p></li></ul><h2 dir=\"ltr\">What we offer</h2><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Flexible working hours and locations.

And we therefore run a slightly unique interview process that begins with an email-based exchange to learn more about your background, communication style and overall fit for the role.</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stage 1</strong>: You\u2019ll begin with an email conversation with our Co-founder, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuacpeacock/\">Josh Peacock</a>, to get a sense of your technical background, written communication, and English proficiency.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stage 2</strong>:\u00a0 Next, you'll have a follow-up email exchange with one of the Makers on our team on a set of more technical questions to get a deeper understanding of your technical knowledge and capabilities.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stage 3</strong>: We\u2019ll then ask you to complete a short technical assignment to demonstrate your practical skills in action.</p></li><li dir=\"ltr\"><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Final stage</strong>: You\u2019ll have two video calls\u2014one with our Founder, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennismortensen\">Dennis Mortensen</a>, and another with a Maker from the team to give us a chance to connect more personally and explore how you'd fit into the team.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p>",
